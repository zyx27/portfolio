    <h1>How participation in Engineering activities are related to studentsâ€™ outcomes?</h1>
    <div id="stu-content">
    <div class="subsection">
      <p>
        We identity clusters of participation based on the number of organizations in which students participate and the frequency that they attend activities, and examine their impact on various social, professional, and academic outcomes, including Bonding Social Capital, Bridging Social Capital, Engineering Identity, Intent to Persist, Major Satisfaction, and grade point average (GPA). 4,022 third- and fourth-year undergraduate engineering students at a large public Midwestern R1 university received a survey instrument, and 998 responded. The survey asked several questions regarding student pre-college and on campus experiences, and resulting outcomes. Students were asked whether they participated in engineering-related co-curricular activities, which ones, and how often.
      </p>
      <p>
        We identify the clusters of participation in co-curricular activities, such as the types of organizations, number of organizations joined, and the frequency of participation, and show how they are related to social, academic, and professional outcomes.
      </p>

    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Research Questions</h2>
      <p>
        We are curious about how participations are related to outcomes. The specific research questions we address are:
      </p>
        <ul id="stu-questions">
          <li>Are there clusters of participation with regard to frequency of participation and number of organizations?</li>
          <li>Are there differences between the clusters and in observed social, professional, and academic outcomes?</li>
        </ul>
      
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        We have tried several clustering methods including K-Means Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN. Unlike supervised learning, it is very hard to evaluate unsupervised learning algorithms as they do not have ground truth.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        We identify 5 clusters of participations:
      </p>
        <ul id="stu-results">
          <li>
            Non-participants who have never participated in any organization
          </li>
          <li>
            Occasional participants who have belonged to a few organizations and are somewhat active in each
          </li>
          <li>
            Regular participants who have also belonged to one or two organizations and attend most activities
          </li>
          <li>
            Selective participants who have involved in one or two organizations and are leaders in the organization
          </li>
          <li>
            Super participants who are involved in two to five organizations and are highly active and/or leaders in one or two.
          </li>

        </ul>
